#This file contains information about the wind tunnle experiment. 

Test duration(sec): 120
Sampling rate(Hz): 400
Number of samples: 48000
Number of taps:	   367
Number of inputs: 384

The total number of measurment inputs in the wind tunnel is greater than the 
number of taps used. The tap count is 367 while the number of measurment points 
from the wind tunnel is 384, the remaining taps are measurments of other probes 
placed for monitoring perpose in the wind tunnel.  

The following profiles are used: 

Open – Profile 3

Suburban– Profile 15

Urban – Profile 12 (I noticed you don’t have that page)

Blorken taps: ['110','613','1014', '1213', '2315']
